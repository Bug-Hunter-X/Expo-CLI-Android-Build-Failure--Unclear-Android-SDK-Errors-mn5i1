This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android SDK is not properly configured or is missing necessary components. This can happen due to several reasons, including incorrect environment variables, missing or outdated Android SDK tools, or issues with the Android build system itself.  The error message itself might not be very specific, making it difficult to diagnose the exact cause. Example error messages might be generic such as "Build failed" or "Android SDK not found".
