To resolve the Android SDK configuration issues, several steps can be taken:

1. **Verify Android SDK Installation and Environment Variables:** Ensure the Android SDK is correctly installed and that the environment variables `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` are properly set to point to the correct directories.  You may need to restart your terminal or IDE after setting these variables.

2. **Install Required Android SDK Components:** Use the Android SDK Manager to install the necessary build tools, platforms, and APIs.  Ensure that you have the correct Android platform and build tools for your project. Often the issue is missing build-tools or platforms.

3. **Check for SDK Manager Errors:** When you open the Android SDK Manager, look for any error messages or warnings that could be preventing proper functionality.

4. **Update SDK Components:** Update the components of the SDK to the latest versions to ensure compatibility and fix potential bugs.

5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning your project and rebuilding it. Use `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo build:android`.

6. **Check for conflicting SDK installations:** Make sure you only have one Android SDK installation and that the environment variables point to the correct one.

7. **Run Expo CLI commands with debugging information:** Include the `--verbose` flag with expo commands to obtain more detail about errors.

8. **Examine the build logs:** Carefully examine the full output of the build command to look for hints about the specific problem. Look at the end for specific error messages.

By systematically addressing these points, developers can identify and rectify the underlying Android SDK configuration issues and successfully build their Android APKs using Expo CLI.
